            Our founderâ€™s childhood was adversely impacted by the criminal
            justice system, as her father endured detention for a crime he did
            not commit. Motivated by a desire for change, she pursued a legal
            education to confront the inequities inherent in the system. With a
            background in law and as a Commonwealth scholar at Oxford, she has
            dedicated over a decade to creating systemic change through
            innovation and brilliance.
